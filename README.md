# reproduction-project-DL2021
This project represents our attempt at reproducing the results of a scientific paper, namely Scale-Equivariant Steerable Networks (SESN) by Ivan Sosnovik, Michał Szmaja, and Arnold Smeulders. <br>
We have reproduced the data augmentation steps, re-run the MNIST experiments, and produced quasi-equivalent results. We tried to run the STL–10 experiments but the lack of computational resources got the better of us. Also, we tried to implement the layers themselves and, although we weren’t able to test it, we believe that we have successfully implemented the T→H layer.
